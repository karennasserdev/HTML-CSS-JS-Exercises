HTML Structure

DOCTYPE html: Specifies witch version of HTML is being used.

Meta tag: The browser interprets the estructure trought TAGS, but its not rendered.

HTML:

• Is the root element. The elements (head, meta-tags, title, body...) that form the page content are put between the opening tag <html> and cloging tag </html>. • HTML is a series of tags that surround or mark up
different parts of the content so you have a certain
appearance or a certain behavior.

HTML elements:

Delimited by the characters ‘<‘ and ‘>’
• Usually made up of an initial pair - initial or opening tag and final or closing tag. Example: <p></p>
• closing tag can be omitted in cases that do not exist
content between pair. Example: <img/>

Attributtes:
• Elements may also contain attributes, which are presented in the
as follows: <tag attribute = “value”> text </tag>
example: <p class = “blue-text”> text </p>
• Attributes contain extra information about the element, but not visible as the content.
• An important lang attribute in <html> tag indicates the file content language, and is important for accessibility (automatic translation) and search engines. example: <html lang = “en”>
• Lang attribute value:
    1. Letters **before** hyphen specify language: pt, en, es, ...
    2. Letters **after** hyphen specify country: PT, BR, US, GB, ... 
    Examples: pt-PT, pt-BR, en-US, en-GB, es-ES, es-AR...

Head Element:

<head></head>
• The <head> element acts as a container for all content of the HTML page that is not visible to users.
• Contains essentially metadata about the HTML document: <meta charset = "utf-8"> - This element specifies the character encoding of the document, the character set that the document is allowed to use.
• A mobile-optimized site must contain the meta with access to viewport: <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initialscale =
1.0, user-scalable = no ">
    1. The width property controls the size of the viewport;
    2. The initial-scale property controls the zoom level when the page is loaded;
    3. User-scalable controls user permission to increase or page shrinkage;
• Specify a description that includes related keywords
page content helps position the page well in the ranking
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

• Many <meta> elements include name and content attributes:
<meta name = "author" content = "Karen Nasser">
<meta name = "description" content = "Html5, js, css...">
<meta name = "keywords" content = "sites, responsive, html, html5">
<meta name = "rating" content = "General">
<meta name = "revisit-after" content = "5 days">









<title></title>
• The title element is NOT a Meta Tag but is one of the MOST IMPORTANT in SEO;
• It is one of the items that most influences positioning on Google, if
not the most important;
• The purpose of the Google algorithm is to be able to show people the results most relevant to your searches;
• Search Results Title helps us quickly find what we are looking for;
